# A Sudoku Solver

## Description

The Sudoku Solver is a Python program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles with ease. This program allows users to input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle grid, representing the puzzle's initial state. The solver employs the backtracking algorithm, a suitable technique for exploring possible solutions, to fill in the missing numbers and find the correct arrangement of numbers that satisfy the Sudoku rules. Once the puzzle is solved, the program displays the completed Sudoku grid, providing users with an instant solution to the puzzle.

## Example

Suppose you have the following unsolved Sudoku puzzle:

```
